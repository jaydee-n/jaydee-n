## Hi! I'm Jaydee 😄
🖥️ I'm currently a junior undergrad at CSULB, majoring in Computer Science.

💭 I'm currently working on a deep-learning, computer vision model regarding public surveillance under Qualcomm, through a collaboration with Break Through Tech AI at UCLA!

💡 I'm passionate about how artifical intelligence intersects with other fields of computer science, especially security and cybersecurity. I'm also deeply interested in data science and machine learning.
